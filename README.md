### Hi, I'm Dom. 👋

I am a **Software Engineer** specializing in **Network Automation**, **System Architecture**, and **Data Ownership**. 

I build tools that streamline complex workflows—from managing media server metadata to automating macOS productivity tasks. My background in high-pressure live event production has instilled a "reliability-first" approach to every system I architect.
